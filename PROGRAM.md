# Program State

Project state + handoff for humans, engineers, and AI agents. Read this before non-trivial work.
Keep it concise (see `CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md` → **Program State**).

## Right Now

- **Phase 0 — Gate & scaffolding.** The repo skeleton ([`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](./docs/ARCHITECTURE.md))
  and the frozen floor ([`DECISIONS.md`](./DECISIONS.md)) are in; the AI-operating layer lands with
  **E0-6 (#18)** (this file set). The **agent skill layer** is in: the **skills.sh lock + consumer `.agents/skills/`
  wiring** (PR #89 — `bun`/`turborepo`/`karpathy-guidelines` + the `assay-brain` recall skill, vendored and
  symlinked into `.claude/`+`.hermes/`; `assay-brain` built in `AssayInc/skills`, **#73**, closed),
  the **prefer-official cloud/IaC/training/eval/dev-loop packs** (**E0-10 (#85)**, landed — 25 skills:
  18 official-vendor (AWS / Terraform / OpenEnv / TRL / Python-UV / LocalStack + `skill-creator`), 3 Inspect AI
  (maintainer-authored, `meridianlabs-ai`), and 4 well-adopted community (`wshobson/agents` — TS/Python craft)),
  and the **five homegrown AssayOps domain skills** (**E0-11 (#86)**, landed — `write-isolated-verifier` /
  `reward-ledger-worm` / `deterministic-verification` / `red-team-exit-bar` / `eval-rigor`, authored in
  `AssayInc/skills` and vendored here). Other ready E0 work: two-lane CI + branch
  protection (**E0-2, #19**), the LocalStack dev loop (**E0-3, #20**), repo hygiene (**E0-4, #21**), and the
  Project v2 board (**E0-5, #22**). Phase-1 build proper starts at the contract-schema spine (**E1**), the
  join key for the whole system.

## Recently Landed

- **E0-11 (#86): homegrown AssayOps domain skills.** Five brain-distilled skills authored in `AssayInc/skills`
  (each provenance-cited to a brain page/plan, `skill-creator`-authored, independently reviewed by Codex
  `gpt-5.5 xhigh` two-pass and A/B-evaluated) and vendored into the committed layer: `write-isolated-verifier`
  (the trust boundary), `reward-ledger-worm` (the WORM/KMS reward record), `deterministic-verification` (the
  diff-IR reward), `red-team-exit-bar` (the reward-channel red-team gate), `eval-rigor` (the
  eval-to-performance proof protocol). Each `SKILL.md` hash-pinned in `skills-lock.json`, symlinked into
  `.claude/`+`.hermes/`. Homegrown only where no official pack covers the AssayOps-specific need
  (`localstack-verifier` folded into the official `localstack/skills` pack instead). _(fill PR # / merge commit on landing.)_

- **E0-10 (#85): prefer-official skill packs.** 25 skills vendored into the committed layer (18 official-vendor +
  3 maintainer-authored Inspect AI + 4 well-adopted community `wshobson/agents`), each mapped to a coding surface: `skill-creator` (anthropics); AWS `aws-cdk` / `aws-sdk-js-v3-usage` /
  `aws-cloudformation` / `aws-iam` (verifier read surface E2 + CDK adapter/drift E3/E11 + A/B role);
  `terraform-style-guide` / `terraform-test` (adapter-terraform E3); `openenv-cli` / `generate-openenv-env`
  (env-server E5, from canonical `huggingface/OpenEnv` — `meta-pytorch/openenv` now redirects there);
  `hf-cli` / `trl-training` (trainer E12); `uv` / `ruff` (Python lane); LocalStack `localstack` /
  `localstack-deploy` / `localstack-iam` / `localstack-state` / `localstack-logs` (dev loop E0-3, from
  `localstack/skills`); and Inspect AI `map-inspect-packages` / `reading-logs` / `babysitting-evals` (eval
  lane E13, from `meridianlabs-ai/inspect-skills` — Meridian Labs now maintain `inspect_ai`); and TS/Python craft
  `typescript-advanced-types` / `python-testing-patterns` / `python-type-safety` / `async-python-patterns`
  (well-adopted community `wshobson/agents`, where no official skill exists). Vendored verbatim (byte-identical to upstream), symlinked into
  `.claude/`+`.hermes/`, each `SKILL.md` hash-pinned in `skills-lock.json` (scripts/resources guarded by the
  `skills-sync-hygiene` rule, not the lock); the off-target majority of each multi-skill repo excluded
  (prefer-official, smallest-change). All six `CLAUDE.md` preflight domains now have a vendored skill. (PR #91.)

- **E0-6 (#18): AI-operating layer.** `CLAUDE.md` (the single auto-loaded constitution) + `AGENTS.md`
  symlink, `PROGRAM.md`, `ISSUES.md`, `tasks/{todo,lessons}.md`; the **`verify`-gate + locked-fixtures
  loop**, the "implement the next ready issue" trigger, and the quality bar — adapted to the polyglot,
  verification-infra domain. No `HANDOFF.md` (folded into `CLAUDE.md`); no `ci.yml` (that is E0-2/#19).
  _(fill PR # / merge commit on landing.)_
- **E0-8 (#74): `DECISIONS.md`** — the frozen floor (trust model, locked decisions 1C–T3, I1–I11, the
  15-vector threat bar, eval rigor) ported from the `brain` plans so the repo stands alone. (PR #82.)
- **E0-1 (#17): bootstrap polyglot monorepo skeleton** — Bun + Turborepo TS lane (`ts/**`), UV Python
  lane (`py/**`), shared `typescript-config`/`biome-config`, `contracts/` shells, the `verify` task
  graph, committed lockfiles. (PR #83, `c871960`.)

## Handoff Notes

- **CI is E0-2 (#19), not yet landed.** `bun run verify` is the gate and is green locally; the two-lane
  GitHub Actions workflow that runs it per PR (turbo + uv, cache-keyed) and branch protection on `main`
  arrive with E0-2. Until then, the **PR + verify-green + `/review`** convention in `CLAUDE.md` is the
  merge gate. E0-1 deliberately shipped no CI; E0-6 documents the invariant, E0-2 implements it.
- **Brain sibling + skill layer.** Strategy/research/vision live in `../brain/` (`AssayInc/brain`);
  recall via the **`assay-brain`** skill, built in `AssayInc/skills` (**#73**, closed). As of PR #89
  it's **committed into this repo's skill layer** (`.agents/skills/assay-brain`, symlinked into
  `.claude/`+`.hermes/`, `SKILL.md` hash-pinned in `skills-lock.json`), so every agent here — Codex, CI, a fresh clone —
  gets it with zero setup. It also still ships as a **per-developer install** (`AssayInc/skills` →
  `./install.sh`, symlinked into `~/.claude/skills`) that makes recall work from *any* Assay repo; on a dev
  machine that global copy shadows the committed one (same content). Both resolve `../brain` with zero config
  and degrade gracefully when the brain is absent. The prefer-official cloud/IaC/training/eval packs landed
  in **#85** (PR #91 — 25 skills, each `SKILL.md` hash-pinned in `skills-lock.json`); the five homegrown
  domain skills are authored + vendored (**E0-11 / #86**). `CLAUDE.md` documents the layer as the design.
- **Read order for a new agent:** `CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md` (operating layer) → `DECISIONS.md` (why/rules)
  → `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` (how/where). The build spine is the `contracts/` schema (E1) — built first
  because it is the join key both lanes and a buying lab verify against.
